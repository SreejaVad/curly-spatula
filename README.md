# Tri 3 Big Idea 5.1: Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing

 1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
 > * Computing and the internet helps introduce more ways to experience/view the world -> People may become wrapped up in what they see on the internet instead of actaully experiencing the internet.
 > * There is an increased knowledge and understanding -> The overuse of the internet and mobile devices can lead to a numerous amounts of mental and physical health problems.
 > * Improvements in industry and jobs and an interconnectedness of the world as a result of globalization -> human's break their social interact with friends and families
 2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
 >  Dopamine is a type of neurotransmitter that is generally associated with how we as humans feel/experience pleasure. When using technology, Dopamine can be released and our body begins to associate feeling good to using technology. When this happens, our bodies can form a certain reliance on technology that can soon lead to an addiction. For example, when using social media apps, there is ofton a form of a 'for you page' where content is tailored and formed around what is apealing to the users. Pages like this can make people get addicted to viewing the content instead of focusing on resposibilites. 
 
# Tri 3 Big Idea 5.2: Digital Divide

 1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
 > Someone can expower themselves in the digital world by confidently participating in the digital world and building upon the knowledge, experience and values that people already have. 
 2.  How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
 > In many ways they are preventing people from being digitally empowered as a system since it doesn't always make it nesasaary for people to use paper. While paper is a vital part of our society and cannot be replaced, computers should become more accesable and available to the general public. At del norte, we can create technology drives and aother sorts of fundraisers to raise money for technological devices so that the digital devide can be closed in a way. 
 3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
 > Yes, there are many elements preventing digital empowerment such as location, income, and general knowlege of the use of technology. Living in the US, and especially San Diego, many students and people are able to have multiple personal devices without an issue. However, moving away from the US, many developing countries such as India don't necassarily have the same privilge. These barriers exists virtually everywhere, at a larger or smaller scale depending on where you live.

 # Create Task

 * For my create task, I attempted to create a form of a snake game so students can take brain breaks in between their work in a more intereactive way that wouldn't be as addicting as other games. It would be a short break for individuals to contrast the more academic aspects of our website.
