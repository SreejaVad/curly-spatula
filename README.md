## Tri 3 Big Idea 5.1: Beneficial and Harmful Effects of Computing

### 5.1 Notes
* Dopamine plays a role in how we feel pleasure which can be assoiciated with technology (good and bad)
* Anthony Rosner -> hero in the World of Warcraft online gaming community and submerged himself in a fantasy world that seemingly fulfilled his every need -> his real life was virtually nonexistent
* After turning away from the game, Rosner found other sources of pleasure. He joined a gym, started DJing at his university, and became much more active socially. "I couldn't believe what I had been missing," he says.
* Automated telephone trees were designed to save employers money, but also reduce hold time for customers.

### 5.1 Activity
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
> * Computing and the internet helps introduce more ways to experience/view the world -> People may become wrapped up in what they see on the internet instead of actaully experiencing the internet.
> * There is an increased knowledge and understanding -> The overuse of the internet and mobile devices can lead to a numerous amounts of mental and physical health problems.
> * Improvements in industry and jobs and an interconnectedness of the world as a result of globalization -> human's break their social interact with friends and families
2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
>  Dopamine is a type of neurotransmitter that is generally associated with how we as humans feel/experience pleasure. When using technology, Dopamine can be released and our body begins to associate feeling good to using technology. When this happens, our bodies can form a certain reliance on technology that can soon lead to an addiction. For example, when using social media apps, there is ofton a form of a 'for you page' where content is tailored and formed around what is apealing to the users. Pages like this can make people get addicted to viewing the content instead of focusing on resposibilites.

## Tri 3 Big Idea 5.2: Digital Divide

### 5.2 Notes
* Poorer or rural areas in America and other countries may have less or little access to Technology
* Some countries may have different or restricted access, for instance China and USA may have divide in service allowed in their countries.
* Individual may have less access to latest updates, thus may be working on older generations of computers
* Religious groups like the Amish choose not to use technology
* San Diego county has regional distinction in many categories between Northern and Southern population, usually indicated by Interstate 8.
* Sunnyvale CA has been known as technology hub of influence for the entirety of the United States.

### 5.2 Activity
1. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
> Someone can empower themselves in the digital world by confidently participating in the digital world and building upon the knowledge, experience and values that people already have.
2.  How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
> In many ways they are preventing people from being digitally empowered as a system since it doesn't always make it nesasaary for people to use paper. While paper is a vital part of our society and cannot be replaced, computers should become more accesable and available to the general public. At del norte, we can create technology drives and aother sorts of fundraisers to raise money for technological devices so that the digital devide can be closed in a way.
3. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
> Yes, there are many elements preventing digital empowerment such as location, income, and general knowlege of the use of technology. Living in the US, and especially San Diego, many students and people are able to have multiple personal devices without an issue. However, moving away from the US, many developing countries such as India don't necassarily have the same privilge. These barriers exists virtually everywhere, at a larger or smaller scale depending on where you live.

## Tri 3 Big Idea 5.3: Computing Bias

### 5.3 Notes
* Computing bias is something that has been done intentionally as well as unintetiontinally: (Tik Tok vs. Facebook) VS. (The main demographic of HP computor users being white cis men)
* When demographics are targted intentionally, it is done to ensure that the activies are more interactive and personalised for the users. For example, Tik tok, is an app made for teenagers and generally people under 30. If Tik Tok tried marketing to people older, it would no lomger be as intersting for the youth and would most likely lead to a different demographic of users.
* Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri original had flaws in detecting accents or young voices -> unintentional
* One is algorithmic AI bias or “data bias,” where algorithms are trained using biased data. The other kind of bias in AI is societal AI bias

### 5.3 Activity
1. Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
> I don't think the HP computor's creator intentionally made it so that mainly white men had access to the computor. However, it is impotant to note that no drastic steps have ben taken to improve this. 
2. If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
> HP computors were marketed for the general-public. There were no signifiers that it was marketed towards the west only and not outside of that. 
3. How do you think this happened?
> I think this happened due to the digital divide and how many people could actually get access to these computors. The digtal devide has been an issue even going past HP. The only ay to fix this is help end the rampant poverty and un-eduction while also introducing technology such as computors. 
4. Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
> This divide is harmful, however, it wasn't in any way intentional. This unintentional exclusion can lead to a further seperation between the west and the rest of the country. 
5. Should it be corrected?
> This should be corrected in order to help introduce for progress into the world and close the digital divide. 
6. What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
> In order to produce a better outcome, we should be making electronics more available and inexpensive. As well as this, implementing more education on the internet can help people identify and emphasize the importance of technology. 

## Tri 3 Big Idea 5.4: Crowdsourcing

### 5.4 Notes
* Crowdsourcing provides the ability to obtain shared information, share information, and participate in distributed computing
* Wikipedia has a ton of information from crowdsourcing
* Crypto currency and associated block chain
* COVID data, it is easy to recognize areas that are contributing and not contributing.
* We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API's, namely RapidAPI
* we have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository

### 5.4 Activity
1. CompSci has 150 principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment?
> An example of crowd sourcing that can be done in our Computer Science class is a form of a forum where new discoveries of code can be shared. For example, if someone, in their free time were to create a new game or create a mini quiz, they could share the code for this so that their classmates could use this in their own works or to build upon this. As well as this, such as an API, students can create a sort of data base for said quizzes and so then other students can implement the data into their projets.
2. What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your final project be better with crowdsourcing?
> Especially for our project, croud sourcing is something that would be very beneficial. Since our website is a reading website, if we could implement a method for students to edit the summary of books it would help moer students and theorietically add in more reliable infromantion. While this would need a form of monitoring to ensure the information is true, it would add more exposure to more books.


# Create Task

* For my create task, I attempted to create a form of a snake game so students can take brain breaks in between their work in a more intereactive way that wouldn't be as addicting as other games. It would be a short break for individuals to contrast the more academic aspects of our website.
